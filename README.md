# OrbitReport

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

Using the knowledge I gained from LC 101, I created angular components that were responsible for the code that housed a table of satellite data and instantiated it into the HTML of the project(app html), shows the total number of satellites currently displayed in the table, and Modify the search feature to find matches using the orbitType and type properties.

I modified the table to be able to change the number of rows displayed based on the Satellite data that was fetched using an *ngFor loop, making this a flexible Web App.

I also utilized css to add a red background to display whether a spot in the satellite data was space debris or not.
